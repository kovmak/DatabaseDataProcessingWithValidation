# Database Data Processing With Validation

This project, Database Data Processing With Validation, efficiently handles data from databases using the Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern along with validation. It focuses on implementing SOLID principles and GRASP patterns, ensuring high cohesion and low coupling. The system interacts with relational databases through JDBC and facilitates various data processing tasks while ensuring the integrity and validity of the data.

## Overview

The Database Data Processing With Validation system extends the functionality of the DAO pattern by incorporating data validation. Each entity class utilizes the Builder pattern for construction, ensuring flexibility and readability. The Singleton pattern is employed for classes handling CRUD operations, providing a single point of access to the database. Additionally, The Factory Method pattern is utilized for creating instances of DAO classes, ensuring consistency and maintainability. Custom validation logic is implemented to ensure the integrity of the data being processed.

## Task

- Implement SOLID and GRASP principles using the DAO design pattern.
- Utilize the Builder pattern for entity classes for flexible object creation.
- Apply the Singleton pattern to classes implementing CRUD operations for centralized database access.
- Use the Factory Method pattern for creating DAO instances to maintain consistency.
- Implement custom validation logic to ensure data integrity and validity.

## Database Schema

The database schema for the Database Data Processing With Validation system comprises multiple tables, each representing an entity in the domain model. The schema includes tables for entities like Animals, Enclosures, Employees, Visitors, and any additional entities required to model the domain accurately.

## Implementation

The implementation of the Database Data Processing With Validation system follows these guidelines:
- Each entity class implements the Builder pattern for object construction, providing flexibility and readability.
- Classes responsible for CRUD operations utilize the Singleton pattern to ensure a single instance for database access.
- The Simple Factory or Factory Method pattern is used to create instances of DAO classes, promoting consistency and maintainability.
- Custom validation logic is implemented to ensure the integrity and validity of the data being processed.

## Testing

Functional testing of the Database Data Processing With Validation system is conducted using dedicated test classes. Test data is used to validate CRUD operations and ensure data integrity and validity across the system.
